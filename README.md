# Hi! I'm Izabella Doser 👋  

## About Me  
Hi! I'm Izabella (or Bella), a junior studying Computer Science at **San José State University**.  
I'm passionate about **AI/ML**, **human-centered design**, and **responsible computing** — creating technology that’s innovative, inclusive, and sustainable.  

Most recently, I interned at **Google Cloud**, where I co-developed an **Agentic AI security scanner** designed to automate vulnerability detection across 25+ GCP services.  
Through the **Break Through Tech AI Studio**, I’ve also built EEG-driven models that predict engagement and cognitive states from brainwave data — combining neuroscience and machine learning to make learning systems more adaptive.  

- 🌎 Especially interested in the intersection of **AI**, **sustainability**, and **product design**  
- 💡 I love collaborating across disciplines to solve meaningful, real-world problems  
- 🚀 Always learning and building toward ethical, human-centered innovation
